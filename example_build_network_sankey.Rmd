# Sankey from Scratch using `rCharts`, `d3.js`, and `igraph`

## Introduction

This example will walk through the steps of using the `R` package [`igraph`](http://igraph.sourceforge.net/) to create a tree network for a [sankey diagram](http://econ.st/JwNX8s).  This is a great exercise to learn some basics of `igraph`, explore the construction of a sankey, and determine the conditions for a network to be drawn properly as a sankey. After all of this, we will plot our network with the [`rCharts`](http://rcharts.io/site) implementation of the [d3.js sankey plugin](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/blob/master/sankey/sankey.js).


## Build a Network
Let's first start by loading the `igraph` and `rCharts` packages.  Then we will use `graph.tree` to build a tree network with 40 vertices with 4 children.
```{r}
require(igraph)
require(rCharts)

g <- graph.tree(40, children = 4)
```
For fun, we will assign a weight of 1 `E(g)$weight = 1` for each edge and then draw a Sankey diagram using `rCharts`.  Going forward I will try to explain the `R` code through comments in the code block.

## Plot Our Sankey to Find a Problem
```{r}
E(g)$weight = 1

edgelist <- get.data.frame(g) #this will give us a data frame with from,to,weight
colnames(edgelist) <- c("source","target","value")
#make character rather than numeric for proper functioning
edgelist$source <- as.character(edgelist$source)
edgelist$target <- as.character(edgelist$target)

sankeyPlot <- rCharts$new()
sankeyPlot$setLib('libraries/widgets/d3_sankey')
sankeyPlot$setTemplate(script = "libraries/widgets/d3_sankey/layouts/chart.html")

sankeyPlot$set(
  data = edgelist,
  nodeWidth = 15,
  nodePadding = 10,
  layout = 32,
  width = 960,
  height = 500
)

sankeyPlot$print(chartId = 'sankey1')
```

Interact with the sankey plot a little, and try to find the problem in our hastily constructed network.  Hovering over the vertex 4 will reveal our issue.  The edge from 1 to 4 is not as big as the sum of the edges going out from 4.  For this to make sense, unless 4 is magically creating something, the sum of the inflow should equal the sum of the outflow.  Since 4 has four children each with weight of 1 (outflow = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4), we would expect the inflow to also be 4.  It is only 1 though since we made all our edges' weights = 1 `E(g)$weight = 1`.  How then would we build our network with edge weights so that for each vertex, the sum of in equals the sum of out.


## Fix Our Problem For a Beautiful Sankey
I am a network novice, so while the code below works, I am sure there are better ways of accomplishing the desired result.  I heavily commented the code, but I will quickly describe the steps.  The code starts at the lowest level of the heirarchy, or those vertexes where there is nothing going out (out degree = 0).  In our network, these are 11 through 40.  With `igraph` we can identify these by `V(g2)[degree(g2,mode="out")==0]`.  For these we will assign a weight.  Then we will loop through all of the edges summing all of the weights of the out until we have reached the top of the heirarchy.

```{r}
g2 <- graph.tree(40, children=4)
#to construct a sankey the weight of each vertex should be the sum
#of its outgoing edges
#I believe the first step in creating a network that satisfies this condition
#is define a vertex weight for all vertexes with out degree = 0
#but first let's define 0 for all
V(g2)$weight = 0
#now for all vertexes with out degree = 0
V(g2)[degree(g2,mode="out")==0]$weight <- runif(n=length(V(g2)[degree(g2,mode="out")==0]),min=0,max=100)
#the lowest level of the heirarchy is defined with a random weight
#with the lowest level defined we should now be able to sum the vertex weights
#to define the edge weight
#E(g2)$weight = 0.1 #define all weights small to visually see as we build sankey
E(g2)[to(V(g2)$weight>0)]$weight <- V(g2)[V(g2)$weight>0]$weight
#and to find the neighbors to the 0 out degree vertex
#we could do V(g2)[nei(degree(g2,mode="out")==0)]
#we have everything we need to build the rest by summing
#these edge weights if there are edges still undefined
#so set up a loop to run until all edges have a defined weight
while(max(is.na(E(g2)$weight))) {
  #get.data.frame gives us from, to, and weight
  #we will get this to make an easier reference later
  df <- get.data.frame(g2)
  #now go through each edge and find the sum of all its subedges
  #we need to check to make sure out degree of its "to" vertex is not 0
  #or we will get 0 since there are no edges for vertex with out degree 0
  for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
    x = df[i,]
    #sum only those with out degree > 0 or sum will be 0
    if(max(df$from==x$to)) {
      E(g2)[from(x$from) & to(x$to)]$weight = sum(E(g2)[from(x$to)]$weight)
    }
  }
}

edgelistWeight <- get.data.frame(g2)
colnames(edgelistWeight) <- c("source","target","value")
edgelistWeight$source <- as.character(edgelistWeight$source)
edgelistWeight$target <- as.character(edgelistWeight$target)

sankeyPlot2 <- rCharts$new()
sankeyPlot2$setLib('libraries/widgets/d3_sankey')
sankeyPlot2$setTemplate(script = 'libraries/widgets/d3_sankey/layouts/chart.html')

sankeyPlot2$set(
  data = edgelistWeight,
  nodeWidth = 15,
  nodePadding = 10,
  layout = 32,
  width = 960,
  height = 500
)

sankeyPlot2
```

## Another Look at Our Network
There are very [good examples](http://rulesofreason.wordpress.com/tag/plot-igraph/) illustrating the use of `igraph` to plot a network.  This is not one of these examples.  For fun though, let's plot the network with igraph using just the defaults to compare it to our Sankey output from above.

```{r}
plot(g2)
```

## Lots More Sankey
Believe it or not, there is an entire site devoted to sankey diagrams.  For all the sankey you can handle, check out http://sankey-diagrams.com.  Here are a couple more sankeys generated from `rCharts`:  http://rcharts.io/viewer/?6001601#.UeWfuY3VCSo, http://rcharts.io/viewer/?6003605, http://rcharts.io/viewer/?6003575.
